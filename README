It is built on top of InfiniTAM v3, a highly-efficient,
open-source 3D reconstruction engine developed by Oxford's
Active Vision Group. For more details about InfiniTAM v3,
please get in touch with one of the following people:

1. Building the System
----------------------

1.1 Overview

SemanticPaint builds with CMake 3.8.2 and above on Windows, Ubuntu and Mac OS X.
It has been tested on recent versions of all three operating systems, but may
require additional work to build on older versions.

1.2 Dependencies

SemanticPaint depends on various 3rd party libraries. Some of these are
required, in the sense that SemanticPaint will not function without them;
others are optional, but skipping them will reduce functionality.

Suitable versions of the required dependencies and some of the optional
dependencies have been included in the repository, so SemanticPaint should
build "out of the box". However, most users will probably want to install
the remaining optional libraries in order to enable full functionality.

  - ArrayFire (version 3.3.2)
    Status: Optional (needed for touch interaction and median filtering)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_ARRAYFIRE

  - Boost (version 1.56.0)
    Status: Required

  - CUDA (version 8.0)
    Status: Optional (needed for GPU acceleration)
    Default: Enabled
    Flag: WITH_CUDA

  - Eigen (version 3.2.2)
    Status: Required

  - GLEW (version 1.12.0)
    Status: Required on Windows/Ubuntu

  - InfiniTAM (version 3)
    Status: Required

  - Leap Motion SDK (version 2.2.1.24116)
    Status: Optional (needed for experimental Leap Motion support)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_LEAP

  - Oculus SDK (version 0.5.0.1)
    Status: Optional (needed for Oculus Rift support)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_OVR

  - OpenCV (version 3.1.0)
    Status: Optional (needed for feature inspection mode)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_OPENCV

  - OpenGL
    Status: Required

  - OpenMP
    Status: Optional, but recommended (needed for faster training/prediction)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_OPENMP
    Notes: Doesn't work on Mac OS X

  - OpenNI (version 2)
    Status: Optional, but recommended (needed for live reconstruction)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_OPENNI

  - SDL (version 2-2.0.3)
    Status: Required

  - Vicon SDK
    Status: Optional (needed for the Vicon tracker)
    Default: Disabled
    Flag: WITH_VICON

1.3 Build Process

Common steps on all platforms:

  a) Choose a root directory, hereafter referred to as <root>.

  b) Clone the InfiniTAM repository into <root>/InfiniTAM.

  c) Build the spaint_v3 branch of InfiniTAM using CMake (using <root>/InfiniTAM/InfiniTAM/build as your build directory).

  d) Clone SemanticPaint into <root>/spaint, e.g.

     $ git clone git@github.com:torrvision/spaint.git spaint

  e) Change to the spaint directory:

     $ cd spaint

1.3.1 Build Process (Windows)

  f) Using a Bash shell (e.g. Git Bash, provided with msysgit), run the top-level build script, e.g. for VS2013:

    $ ./build-win.sh 12 Release

  g) Run the CMake GUI and specify <root>/spaint/build as the build directory.

  h) Enable any optional libraries you want and supply the paths.

  i) Reconfigure and regenerate the Visual Studio solution.

  j) Build with the optional libraries enabled (just run the above build command again).

1.3.2 Build Process (Unix)

  f) Run the top-level build script:

     $ ./build-nix.sh "Unix Makefiles" Release

  g) Change to the build directory and run ccmake:

     $ cd build
     $ ccmake ..

  h) Enable any optional libraries you want and supply the paths.

  i) Reconfigure and regenerate the makefile.

  j) Build with the optional libraries enabled, e.g.

     $ make -j4

2. Running the System
---------------------

The build process will build various applications, libraries and test
programs in <root>/build. The main application can be found at:

<root>/build/bin/apps/spaintgui/spaintgui

It can be run "out of the box" from any working directory for live
reconstruction, provided you have built with OpenNI support.

If you want to reconstruct from data stored on disk (e.g. the Teddy
sequence that is used in InfiniTAM), you can pass the same parameters
that would normally be passed to InfiniTAM to spaintgui, e.g.:

$ ./spaintgui Teddy/calib.txt Teddy/Frames/%04i.ppm Teddy/Frames/%04i.pgm

The arguments specify a text file containing calibration parameters,
and masks for the RGB and depth images in the input sequence.

3. Additional Documentation
---------------------------

Further details about the original concept for SemanticPaint can be
found in the following paper:

SemanticPaint: Interactive 3D Labeling and Learning at your Fingertips.
ACM Transactions on Graphics, 34(5), August 2015.

There will shortly be a technical report shipped along with this
package to describe the details of our open-source implementation
of the SemanticPaint framework. It is currently in the process of
being written.

4. Troubleshooting Tips
-----------------------

If you have any trouble with the build, here are some of the likely causes:

* The CMake executable is not on your path.
* The MSBuild executable is not on your path. (Windows)
* The Visual C++ compiler (cl.exe) is not on your path. (Windows)
* The latest Visual Studio updates have not been installed. (Windows)
